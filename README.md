# Hexagonal-Septapus-Octet
Deep sea cephalosophy

Thanks for supporting local cephalomusic! We're a bunch of old friends from the Charleston Bump who play a combination of free-jazz, gangsta rap, and baroque-classical tuba-funk. Our major influences are John Philips Sousa, The Shags, Michelle Branch, whales, and Cannibal Corpse. We hope you enjoy our album.
