Thanks for buying our album and supporting local cephalomusic! We're a bunch of old friends from the Charleston Bump who play a combination of free-jazz, gangsta rap, and baroque-classical tuba-funk. Our major influences are John Philip Sousa, The Shaggs, Michelle Branch, whales, and Iron Maiden. We hope you enjoy the tunes!*
